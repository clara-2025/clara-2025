## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am currently working on a career change.  I am in an inperson Java Full Stack Developer bootcamp with Tech Elevator in Columbus, OH.

I have a diverse career background that includes Human Resources, Recruting, Training, Operations and Sales. I have exceptional soft skills.  I am adept at recognizing and understanding context and know how to pivot based on my audience. 

I love to travel, love meeting new people, prone to adventures from the need to see what is around the next corner.

Excited to embark on a career in IT.

My pronouns are she/her.

I spent a month traveling in Iran in 2004.  Absolutely splendid people.  I am reasonably sure they invented hospitality.  I don't traffick in propaganda ;).
